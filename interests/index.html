          <h2>Welcome to my book Corner: Backstory</h2>
          <p>
            Early in my life I discovered I enjoy reading. I remember going often to the local
            library to checkout books. As I grew older I continued to enjoy reading as I would have
            a small personal reading light to read late into the night.
          </p>

            <p>
            In middle school I continued to enjoy reading I mainly enjoyed fictional stories
            and read the majority of the Bluestem books that came out. In 8th grade I remember
            I read at least 16 of the 20 Bluestem books that year. One of the book series I remember
            reading multiple entries of was Enders Game. I joined book club in middle school
            one of the few memories I have of middle school book club is that I read all the books
            for book club except the one book where we tried to read The Count of Monte Cristo.
            The average length of a book we read was about 300-500 pages so a book around 1,500 pages
            was a little too much to read, but one person did read the entire book which I look still
            back and find impressive to this day.
          </p>

            <p>
            In high school I continued reading and joined book club again in high school. In high
            school I had less time to read but continued reading. Of note, there was only one other
            male that frequently showed up besides myself that I know of. I read many of the
            mainstream popular series like all of Percy Jackson, The Hunger games, Divergent, and
            The Maze Runner. The last three though in particular of the mainstream novels all set
            the trend for dystopian settings that inspired many authors which I believe played part
            in the my decline for reading. After seeing the same story basis and plot over with the
            new wave of Dystopian novels like Red Queen, it ended up being the last one I read.
            I stopped enjoying seeing the same female lead, male lead play out again and again without
            a noticeable enough change in the formula to keep my interest. Even if I liked these young
            adult books there was only so much I could take of the same mainstream titles. This was
            not the only reason I lost interest though.
          </p>

            <p>
            The second reason I lost interest in books most likely was  book club itself.
            At the start, I could read every book that we read once per month. But as time went on
            and interest of what the club wanted to read and what titles interested me that we didn't
            read I slowly lost interest. Being in a club with about a 1:15 male female ratio led
            most of the books to understandably a more female interest(side note mystery books were
            the most popular books they chose to read). Even though I did read books like The
            Selection and the Lunar Chronicles not apart of book club that were for a female audience.
            Even if some were interesting reading many books month after month that didn't interest
            you took its toll.
          </p>

            <p>
            The third reason mainly came down to the fact that I could not find what I was looking for
            in books. I myself am a fan of fantasy, fictional worlds, and youth romance. Such as:
            The Brotherband Chronicles, Legend by Marie Lu, The other series I enjoyed more from
            the maze runner author The Game of Lives, and Ready Player One (the movie got its
            references updated to the current modern times when it came out). I enjoy these more
            fictional young adult books but I found it difficult to find young adult books that fell
            into that genre. Non-dystopian fantasy worlds that targeted the young adult audience is
            not common. Those seem to fall into the societal trap of growing too old for such stories,
            as such I never really found books that were similar as I grew older. The closest to such
            types of stories were Ready Player One and The Game of Lives. But those focused more on
            video games and escaping the dystopian reality.
          </p>

            <p>
            The last reason was with my waning interest in books my other interest took its time.
            Around the time when I started getting less and less interested in reading, I focused
            on my other hobby that I had been playing more of, video games, specifically
            Super Smash Bros and MOBAs. My friends and I always played against each other during
            that time and I also enjoyed MOBAs for years which shifted my interest in reading books
            that were not catching my attention anymore.In the end, with my lack of interest in these
            stories along with my other interests taking from the time I read I drifted away from
            western novels, but I would eventually return.

          <h2>Anime, Manga, and Light Novels</h2>
          <p>
            Around this time where I was less interested in reading and more interested in playing
            video games, something happened during spring break: I got all of my wisdom teeth
            removed. While this may seem insignificant, it put me in a particular situation where I
            couldn't do anything. I didn't want to read because nothing interested me, I didn't want
            to only play video games all the time with the amount of thinking required when playing
            against another person would be too much after a whiwl, and I was left there to just sit
            on the couch and just watch tv and deal with any lingering pain.
          </p>


            <p>
            The thing is though I don't watch cable tv nor did I have netflix, so I never got around
            to watching any tv anymore. After no longer being as interested in cartoons on tv I
            got interested in watching hockey and watched the 2014 season, then watched them play
            and then win in the 2015 season, but after that the 2016 season I stopped watching them
            and watching tv all together.
          </p>

            <p>
            All that being said because I didn't watch tv and wanted to watch something while I was
            just sitting at home recovering, I decided to go and check out Crunchyroll. This was not
            the first time as years before I had seen some shows before but I just forgot about
            them. My friend also had shown me one that was really good that I was shown and watched
            called One Punch Man. So I went and checked what they were advertising and I watched
            Rising of the Shield Hero and then That time I got Reincarnated as a Slime and they were
            great.
          </p>

            <p>
            I love Isekai, Remember how I talked about enjoying fantasy, video games, and the
            worldbuilding? This had exactly what I was looking for. These stories are like a
            Dungeons and Dragons role playing game type story or a video game RPG like Dragon Quest.
            Basically, my favorite type is isekai literally meaning another world. People get sent
            to another whether it be death, summoned, hit by a truck, or what not and usually go on
            an adventure. This is what I could not find in western stories. Along with the anime and
            manga I so many different types of stories and culture shown to me.
          </p>


            <p>
            With many of the anime being adapted from manga, which are basically just
            Japanese comics but are mainly in black and white I also got into light novels and
            started to read again.
          </p>

            <p>
            With light novels as the name implies, are not full novels, and are smaller than a
            regular novel. They are printed usually on A6 paper and the size is small enough to
            easily carry around. There are a few details that standm out to me that I find when
            comparing what I was used to, to the new form of media I was reading. The main
            difference was that there were illustrations. Not just on the cover, but within the book
            itself. Apprently, they were added to compete against manga. This is one of the biggest
            noticible factors that I wish was added to more western novels. While it is nice using
            your imagination to imagine the scene in your head, having illustrations to enhance
            reader experirence is such a surreal factor as this can create scenes that blow you
            away. I enjoy looking at the hardcover booksleve cover art, but those get damaged easily
            and are not common and are usually simple in design. And I'm stuck staring at a blank
            hardcover book.
          </p>

            <p>
            The second factor are the titles themselves. A trend in some of the titles of the books,
            anime, and manga is to have the title explain what the story is about. The title That
            time I got Reincarnated as A Slime tells you exactly what the story is about. That's
            what the point of a synopsis is, but if no one reads the synopsis is then whats the
            point? Now i'm not saying every title should be like this, but I find this trend that
            developed interesting as it really stands out and is a very effective tactic.
          </p>

            <p>
            The last factor I've been looking for the website equivalent of Soyetsu in the west.
            Syoetsu or lets become a novelist is a site where anyone can sign up and post a story.
            With the variety of stories many people can post and read the stories then and people
            can discuss in real time and comment and get active feedback about what the audience
            likes and dislikes about the story and build a fanbase and following because of it.
            Many of the top stories then get published and I wonder where is our equivalent website?
            There is no equivalent platform in the west that I have seen or heard of. Other
            countries might have such a site but I wish there was one that was popular in the west.
          </p>

          <h2>My Favorite Book</h2>
          <p>
            Finally I want to talk about my favorite book of all the books I have ever read it would
            be Bottom-tier character Tomozaki by Yuki Yaku.
          </p>
          <figure class="image">
            <img src="../assets/Tomozaki V1 Cover.jpg" alt="Volume 1 Tomozaki">

            <figcaption>
              Volume 1 of "Bottom-tier Character Tomozaki"
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            Surprisingly for how much I love isekai, Bottom-tier character Tomozaki is about
            the best Smash Bros player whos outlook is that life is a crappy game. Through the
            game, he meets Aoi, who is seen as a perfect individual, she offers to teach him how to
            play the game of life.
          </p>

            <p>
            What I really love about this book is how He actively tries to improve himself and play
            the game of life. He has the drive and soul to improve himself. The growth he goes
            through as the series progresses is such a great story. I can relate to his viewpoint
            and thought process having similar thoughts to those he has. The progression, story,
            and character interations is always a treat to see. Do I think this is a book for
            everyone? No, but to me, this book speaks to me in ways no book I have ever read has
            been able to come close to.
