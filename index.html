        <p>
          Hello, My name is Matthew Bellario. I am a student at the Illinois Institute of
          Technology, going for a major in Information Technology and Management. Growing up, I was
          with brand new technology constantly expanding and growing around me. When I was young we
          owned an Ipod Touch and Ipod Nano. In middle school, our class was the first generation to
          use Ipads for learning in school. In high school, we had chromebooks to use for class all
          our four years in high school so I was always surrounded by technology. Because of these
          involvement with technology I became interested and sought to learn more about technology.
